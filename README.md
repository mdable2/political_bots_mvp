# political_bots_mvp
As part of the AssemblyAI Hackathon 2022, this project will serve as an MVP for "political bots" where you can talk directly to the AI form of Joe Biden and Donald Trump!

## Work Log
* [12/9/22 12:40PM] Working on cloning [GODEL](https://github.com/microsoft/GODEL) to start setting up the training pipeline. Also will start work on creating a scraper to get the data from [factba](https://factba.se/). I checked `robots.txt` and it doesn't say I can't scrape so I'm going to use this as my data source since they have transcripts for Joe Biden & Donald Trump.
